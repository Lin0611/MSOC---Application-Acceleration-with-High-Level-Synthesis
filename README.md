<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a repository for hls self-paced projects. There are three projects included:
- fir_example
- FP_ACCUM
- squared_difference_accumulate

**Directory structure**
Each project contains:
* **report** - introduce the project, algorithm, implementation ....
* **src/**
  * original - original code from open source if there is 
  * final (use inline pragma) - include both host and kernel code â€»Note: host code must do auto-check
* **pynq/** - Note it may have multiple code directories for different code structure, named by code-opt  (opt refer to optimization method, e.g. code-OoO  Out-Of-Order)
  * ...
